>>> After deleting Vote/ worker Pod one by one. I was able to access the voting app and resulting app there was no impact on both the applications.
>>>But after deleting the DB pod, it took the worker, resulting in an auto-restart because both were interconnected with each other.
Also on the result app, all the old data was lost and it started showing a new result.




WHY result app STOPPED working after db pod stop ?
>> The DB pod is the only one who stores the data, which means the entire database was inside the DB pod.
so the moment we stopped the DB, the data was lost. So the resulting pod also stops showing results.


HOW YOU MADE THE RESULT POD work ?
To make the result pod work, we need to restart the db pod, so after the restart, it's automatically restart the resulting and worker pod.
